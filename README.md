# Education-L-Systems
This scripts were written when I was studying, so they are quit simple.

There are 3 scrits:

1. fern.py I've written it using python turtle, it just creates Barnsley fern.
2. l-system tree Creates randomized tree, using turtle.
3. Mandelset Creates Mandelbrot set using PyGame and saves it as jpeg, it also can be adjusted to create high resolution image of set. You can check already created image Mandelset.jpeg.
